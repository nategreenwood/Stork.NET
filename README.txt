Stork.NET
Stork.NET is a port of the toy programming language, Stork, created by sigpwned.com.

The original Stork is a learning language created in 10 steps (currently at step 4) to teach language design and implementation in Java. 
I have ported the Java source to .NET along with a Language Service package for integration into Visual Studio 2012. A Language Service
package allows a language to get all the benefits of the VS IDE including syntax highlighiting, color, brace completion, a complete
project system (such that creating project in Visual Studio will expose a Stork.NET option) and more.
